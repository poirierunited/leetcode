# LeetCode Solutions

This directory contains solutions to LeetCode problems. Each problem is organized in its own directory with a descriptive name.

## Directory Structure

Each problem directory should follow this structure:
```
problemName/
├── main.go           # Solution implementation
├── main_test.go      # Test cases
└── README.md         # Problem description, approach, and complexity analysis
```

## Naming Convention

Problem directories should be named using camelCase and be descriptive of the problem. Examples:
- `twoSum/`
- `addTwoNumbers/`
- `longestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters/`
- `medianOfTwoSortedArrays/`

## README.md Template

Each problem's README.md should include:
1. Problem description
2. Approach explanation
3. Time complexity
4. Space complexity
5. Example inputs and outputs
6. Any notes or edge cases to consider
