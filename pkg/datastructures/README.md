# Data Structures

This directory contains implementations of common data structures used in algorithm problems.

## Structure

- `linkedlist/` - Linked List implementations (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- `tree/` - Tree implementations (Binary Tree, BST, AVL, etc.)
- `graph/` - Graph implementations (Directed, Undirected, Weighted)
- `heap/` - Heap implementations (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- `stack/` - Stack implementation
- `queue/` - Queue implementation
- `hashmap/` - Hash Map implementation
- `trie/` - Trie implementation

Each data structure should include:
- Implementation file(s)
- Test file(s)
- README.md with usage examples and time/space complexity
